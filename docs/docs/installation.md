# Installation

`multicommand` is hosted on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/multicommand/) and should be installable using any tool which can pull from there.

## System Requirements

`multicommand` requires `python >= 3.6` and is a pure python package. It should run on any OS that python will run on.

## With `pip`

The quickest way to get multicommand is with `pip`

```bash
pip install multicommand
```

## With `poetry`

Even better, if you're using [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) (_poetry is fantastic, btw_) then just

```bash
poetry add multicommand
```
